    Who am I?

</h1>
<span>
    A senior software developer with deep roots in system-level engineering and a passion for building reliable, high-performance software. With nearly 20 years of experience across C/C++, .NET, JavaScript, and Java, I've delivered everything from low-latency drivers and VOIP systems to large-scale, cloud-based web platforms handling tens of thousands of requests per second. I enjoy solving tough technical problems, leading cross-functional teams, and exploring emerging technologies like Rust, Elixir, and Go. This blog is my space to share insights from real-world software developmentâ€”whether it's debugging quirks, architecture patterns, or thoughts on evolving tech.
